# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

### Hi, I'm Frida! ðŸ‘‹

The assignment was to create my own portfolio and following a given design. Also practice my skills in React, HTML and CSS skills.

I had Alot of trouble along the way and I'm not done. The responsive is not correct and it's alot that i need to do there. I started with Mobile so that's the one thats mostly correct.

### Lessons Learned

Next time going in to a bigger project like this i will plan a bit more before starting. Keeping track of all the files has been a challenge and next time I will think a bit more on how to structure it.
